# Delhi Metro Network Analysis  
### [Project view ](https://nbviewer.org/github/kamakshii22/Metro_Network_Analysis/blob/main/Delhi_metro_network_analysis.ipynb)

## Introduction 

Delhi Metro serves as a vital transportation system for the residents of Delhi, India. This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of the network utilizing data visualization techniques and analytical tools.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used contains information about Delhi Metro stations, including station names and IDs, geographical coordinates, line information, distance from the start of each line, opening dates, and station layouts.

## Analysis Sections

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and identify any duplicates.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Converting data types as necessary, such as converting the 'Opening Date' column to datetime format.

3. **Geospatial Analysis:** Visualizing the geographical distribution of metro stations on an interactive map using Folium. This provides insights into the spatial layout of the network.

4. **Temporal Analysis:** Analyzing the growth of the Delhi Metro network over time by counting the number of stations opened each year and visualizing the trend.

5. **Line Analysis:** Examining various metro lines in terms of the number of stations and the average distance between stations to understand their characteristics.

6. **Station Layout Analysis:** Exploring the distribution of station layouts (elevated, underground, at-grade) across the network to identify any patterns or trends.

## Insights and Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into different aspects of the Delhi Metro network, which can be beneficial for urban planners, transportation authorities, and commuters. Understanding the spatial distribution, temporal growth, line characteristics, and station layouts can aid in decision-making processes and optimization strategies.
